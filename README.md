# Price-Comparison-Website

- I have included an mp4 video file to show the website working and its functionality.
- I have included a file (Coursework 1 / Price Comparison Website Project Report) showing how i created this website in detail.

# Summary

The website I created compares the prices of a range of iPhones from iPhone 6 to the latest iPhone 13. The web design is simple and easy, to allows quick
and easy price comparison between several stores. Web scraping was used to grab information (from 6 sites) such as the iPhones name, description and price.
this was then presented within the website I have created in a neatly format. The website also consists of a search bar, for specific searches, the user 
can search for an iPhone and those iPhones that are related to the user search will be presented along with the image and description. The iPhone are 
presented across many pages by the use of pagination. When an iPhone is selected, a page will appear with the iPhoneâ€™s details along with the prices of 
multiple iPhone deals (for the selected iPhone). The user will also have an option to be redirected to the site (which sells the iPhone). From then the 
user can get an in-depth detailed description on the iPhone helping them to decide to buy it or not. This website is not aimed to sell the iPhone in fact
it is used to compare iPhones from several different sites allowing the user to get the best possible deal.
